# Since we know the 5-number summary of each stock price, we will look at how their prices change over time. The line chart below, while too complicated and dirty, shows us that most stocks started from a real low point and continue that way until the end of our time. So I will look at the central tendency graph and pick 5 outstanding stocks and 5 stocks with lower prices.

# ## Moving Window Correlation Discussion
# 
# I adjusted the window size from one month to one year in the graphs and found that using a one-month window makes it difficult to interpret the values. On the other hand, extending the window to six months or a year results in the loss of many changes over time. So, I decided to stick with the 3-month window size.
# 
# Looking at how correlation change over time and observing the dramatic changes, we can say that the correlation matrix provided above can be deceptive. For instance, we initially observed a strong negative correlation between HALKB and SODA. However, when using Moving Window Correlation, we discovered that between the second half of 2014 and 2016, there was a positive correlation between the prices of these stocks. After 2018, a negative correlation emerged, but it's important to note that we can't make general conclusions about an overall negative correlation between these two stock prices.
# 
# We know there is an increasing trend in all stock prices between 2014 and 2017, leading to mainly positive correlations during those years in any pair of stocks. However, in 2018, the devaluation of the Turkish Lira against the USD began, and this had varying effects on each stock over different time periods. This currency depreciation, coupled with the unbalanced state of the markets, led to dramatic ups and downs in some stocks, particularly in THYAO. Therefore, we can attribute the numerous correlation changes in 2018 and 2019 to these factors.
# 
# Finally, I examine the correlation between FROTO and TUPRS to understand how two companies from the same group react to currency devaluation. To provide a broader perspective and demonstrate that a 6-month period can be misleading at first, I use two different window sizes to analyze the stock prices of these two companies.
# 
# It becomes evident that when we employ the 6-month window size, some negative movements in these two stock prices may be overlooked. However, it also allows us to see that there is generally a strong correlation between these two stocks, a pattern that persists even after the events of the year 2018.

# In[34]:


print (pca.explained_variance_ratio_ )


# We see that PC1 explains nearly half of the variance. This ratio decrease to %5 in PC4, so we can neglect it because 3 components can explain over 75% However, I would like to keep it since it does not make complex the model and increase the explained variance by 5 points.

# Covariances of all pairs of different components are zero, which tells us that these components are orthogonal to each other and captures different aspects of the data. It shows that PCA is working correctly on the data. 
# 
# The diagonal values provide us with the eigenvalues for the principal components. The sum of the diagonal values gives us the overall variability. It's worth noting that PC1, represented as '0' in the heatmap, explains nearly half of the total variance, which was already obvious from explained_variance_ratio. 
# 
# 

# In[66]:


print(loadings)


# Finally, we will look at the loadings. We can observe that each principal component has loadings from every stock, with some being negative and others positive. When we focus on PC1, we notice that all stocks have negative loadings, except for TTKOM, SKBNK, GUBRF, CCOLA, BAGFS, and HALKB. The magnitudes of these loadings are generally greater than 10%. It's interesting to note that all components include all features from the data, so we cannot assert the dominance of any specific feature.
# 
# We can refer to these components as latent variables since they can account for over 80% of the variance, which is a substantial amount. Initially, we had 60 observable variables, and now we have reduced them to just 4 latent variables (principal components) while explaining over 80% of the variance. 

# # Google Trends

# ## OTKAR & TUPRS
# 

# ![OTKAR%20TUPRS%20Google%20Trend.png](attachment:OTKAR%20TUPRS%20Google%20Trend.png)

# People often search for these companies using their formal names, not with their stock names, and the most commonly searched word with these formal names is 'investing'. So, I choose to search them in Google Trends with their formal names since there is no results for IST: OTKAR and does not show anything under this name. 
# 
# However, the search trends do not align with their stock prices. For instance, TUPRS is more popular in Google Trends, despite having a significantly lower price than OTKAR. It shows that sometimes popularity of something in Google does not align with the value of that thing. 

# ## HALKB

# In this case, there are more results for HALKBANK in Google Trends compared to IST:HALKB. However, we need to consider that Halkbank has faced a negative public perception, particularly in the year 2018, which could potentially distort the data we are examining. For this reason, I choose to focus only on IST:HALKB.
# 
# When we examine the trend, we observe that the decreasing trend in Google Trend data is more dramatic than in the stock prices, but it generally aligns with them. The first noticeable declining trend appears in the stock prices is in 2016, and it is followed by a sharp decrease in the Google Trends search results.
# 
# ![IST%20HALKB%20Google%20Trends.png](attachment:IST%20HALKB%20Google%20Trends.png)

# ## THYAO
# 
# I excluded the THY and Turkish Airlines keywords because they are most closely associated with terms like 'flight number' or 'airport.' However, with IST: THYAO, it is primarily searched alongside ASELS, TUPRS, and EREGL. As a result, I've decided to analyze them together in the same graph and will also include the stock price over time graph for these three. I excluded TUPRS since this stock has a solid domination in terms of popularity among all and make it harder to understand the relationship between others in the graph.

# Between 2014 and 2015, there was no notable search activity for any of these keywords. During this period, ASELS stock prices experienced a steady increase, reaching a peak at the end of 2018, and people began searching for this stock more frequently. However, the peak in search activity coincided with a significant event in July 2018 when President ErdoÄŸan introduced a new cabinet and treasury secretary, affecting ASELS as it is a governmental institution. As a result, it's not surprising to see ASELS as the most affected stock by government policies. Subsequently, interest in ASELS decreased, although the stock price recovered from the shock effect but followed a declining trend.
# 
# We observe a similar pattern with THYAO but on a smaller scale. There was a second peak in THYAO prices shortly after July 2018, in October 2018, coinciding with the highest search activity for this stock.
# 
# In the case of EREGL, there were no distinct peaks in Google Trends data, except for the last month of this dataset in July 2019. Notably, there were no dramatic shifts in the price of this stock during the same period. Therefore, the increased interest in this stock could be only a coincidence.
# 

# ### Remark:
# This was my first experience applying PCA to data using Python and I could not use the codes provided in the Moodle since it was in R. So, I had to search for and gather codes from various websites and forums.
